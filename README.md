# Flashtest

Flashtest is a powerful CLI-based penetration testing tool designed to assist in reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and AI-driven exploit simulations. It integrates with various security tools to provide comprehensive security testing for web applications, servers, and networks.

## Features

- **Reconnaissance**: Perform DNS lookups, WHOIS searches, and gather IP information.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Run SQL injection tests, Nmap port scanning, and Nikto scans.
- **AI-Assisted Exploitation**: Use AI to simulate exploit scenarios for testing vulnerabilities.
  
## Installation

### Install via pip:
```bash
pip install flashtest
```

### Verify the installation:
```bash
flashtest --help
```

## Usage

Flashtest provides several commands for performing penetration testing operations.

### Reconnaissance Commands

#### DNS Information:
Get DNS information for a domain.
```bash
flashtest --dns example.com
```

#### WHOIS Information:
Retrieve WHOIS data for a domain.
```bash
flashtest --whois example.com
```

#### IP Information (Reverse DNS + Geolocation):
Get IP info, including reverse DNS and geolocation data.
```bash
flashtest --ipinfo 192.168.1.1
```

### Scanning Commands

#### SQL Injection Test:
Test for SQL Injection vulnerabilities on a web page (e.g., login form).
```bash
flashtest --sql http://example.com/login
```

#### Nmap Port Scan:
Scan a target for open ports using Nmap.
```bash
flashtest --nmap 192.168.1.1
```

#### Nikto Scan:
Run a basic security scan using Nikto.
```bash
flashtest --nikto http://example.com
```

### AI-Driven Exploitation

#### Simulate AI-Driven Exploitation:
Use AI to simulate a penetration test on a web target and find potential vulnerabilities.
```bash
flashtest --ai-exploit http://example.com
```

### Combined Vulnerability Identification

#### Identify SQL and Nikto Vulnerabilities:
Automatically identify SQL injection vulnerabilities and run Nikto for additional checks.
```bash
flashtest --identify http://example.com
```
